## Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at Virginia Tech with a passion for building tools that improve everyday workflows — whether it's automating shift scheduling or integrating productivity into Spotify.

🔧 I like working on:
- 🧠 Chrome extensions that boost focus (see **Pomofy**)
- 🗓️ Schedulers and automation tools (see **Schedule Scraper**)
- 📺 Media tracking apps (see **What's on Tonight?**)
- 💻 Full-stack experiments with React, Tailwind, and Spring Boot

🧩 I'm currently building a **Persona 5 Fusion Calculator** powered by Java and working on a React/Next.js frontend.

🌱 Always learning — currently diving into:
- 🔄 Java Spring Boot
- ⚛️ React + Next.js
- 🤖 AI integrations for practical web tools
